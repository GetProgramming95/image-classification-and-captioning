# Final Project: Image Classification and Captioning with Deep Learning

This project showcases a deep learning pipeline that performs image classification and generates natural language captions for given images. The notebook includes data preparation, model training, and inference using pre-trained architectures.

##  Features
- Image classification using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
- Caption generation using Encoder-Decoder architecture (e.g., CNN-RNN).
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning.
- Evaluation with BLEU or similar metrics.

##  Structure
- `Final_Project_Classification_and_Captioning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code, from preprocessing to training and evaluation.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on the implementation)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK / SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

##  Dataset
Typically based on:
- **MS COCO**, **Flickr8k/30k**, or custom datasets (please check dataset source in notebook).

##  How to Run
1. Install dependencies (see notebook's setup cell).
2. Run notebook in order or section-wise.
3. Provide image inputs to test caption generation interactively.

##  Sample Output
- Top-5 predicted classes
- Example: `"A group of people riding horses on a beach"`
- Visualization of attention maps (if applicable)
